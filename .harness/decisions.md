# Decision log

This file records decisions the agents made autonomously per the decision
policy in CLAUDE.md. The main session and subagents APPEND entries here as
decisions are made. The main session READS this file at the start of every
task and stage to maintain consistency.

## Rules

- Append-only. Do not edit or remove prior entries; supersede them with a
  new entry that references the prior one.
- One entry per decision. If a single design choice has several sub-decisions,
  one entry covers them -- don't fragment.
- If a new decision contradicts an earlier one, that IS an escalation. Surface
  the contradiction to the human before proceeding.

## Entry format
