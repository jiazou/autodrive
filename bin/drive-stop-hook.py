/drive autonomous-continuation Stop hook.

Wired into ~/.claude/settings.json by bin/install-operating-rules.sh. On every Stop it
BLOCKS the turn from ending while an active /drive run owned by THIS session still has
autonomous work to do — so the pipeline keeps driving across turns — and ALLOWS the
stop the moment the run is waiting on the human (Gate A/B, a non-decision STOP, an
AskUserQuestion) or is done.

Design bias: blocking a stop is the "dangerous" action (it can push the agent past a
halt), so this hook is biased HARD toward allowing. It blocks ONLY on positive
evidence that this session owns a not-done run that is not waiting and not disabled.
Every other path — unparseable input, no session id, no matching run, kill-switch,
any exception — ALLOWS the stop. A bug here can annoy (a run stops early and you nudge
it) but must never trap a session.

Layered guards: (1) stop_hook_active loop guard, (2) session-scoped run match,
(3) per-run kill-switch (autoContinue:false), (4) fail-open on every error,
(5) Claude Code's built-in consecutive-block cap as a final backstop.

state.json contract /drive maintains (see drive.md):
  sessionId    — owning Claude session id ($CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID)
  stage        — pipeline stage; "done" once the PR is open
  autoContinue — if exactly False, this hook is disabled for the run (kill-switch)
  waiting      — truthy while paused for the human (gate / STOP / question); else absent
